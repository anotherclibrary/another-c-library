This software contains code and ideas derived from works
published by Robert Sedgewick relating to the Red-Black Tree
and the Quicksort algorithm.  In the development of this work,
many other works (both code and explanations) were studied.
I have tried to write the code without borrowing any code or
explanations from other projects.  In algorithms, there is
often one way to do things, so the code and/or explanations
may look the same.
