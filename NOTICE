Another C Library
Copyright 2019 Andy Curtis.

This software contains code and ideas derived from works
published by Robert Sedgewick relating to the Red-Black Tree
and the Quicksort algorithm.  In the development of this work,
many other works (both code and explanations) were studied.
I've spent a lot of time reviewing the standard template
library in C++'s implementation and details of the linux
kernel.  I have tried to write the code without borrowing any code
or explanations from other projects, but I'm sure that my
approaches, variable names, etc will look similar due to the
amount of time that I've worked in the space.  I've worked with
brilliant engineers over the years and certainly borrowed approaches
from their work.  I will try and call out where I learned things if
I they were largely derived from someone else's work.  My goal in
starting this project is that others would eventually contribute
and that my work would serve as a start for something better.  I'm
sure that there are better ways to do things and welcome help!
